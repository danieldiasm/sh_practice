Since we have the name of the variable to set stored in a variable, we can't set the variable directly, we have to use eval to actually do the setting.
The eval statement basically tells bash to interpret the line twice, the first interpretation above results in the string result='some value' which is
then interpreted once more and ends up setting the caller's variable.
